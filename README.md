## Introduction

###Tutorial Portfolio
I made this portfolio with the help from a tutorial by developedbyed to learn how to use TailwindCSS, and practice Next.js and React.

## Technologies
* Next.js
* React/JSX
* TailwindCSS

## Getting Started

You will need to install Next.js and TailwindCSS on your machine to run this code. 

## Reflections

I worked through this tutorial in an afternoon to familiarize myself with TailwindCSS and Next.js. I wanted to learn these so I can utilize them in building my new portfolio website.

Some challenges were finding that the next/image properties - objectFit and layout - were removed since the tutorial was created,so I improvised some tailwind work arounds to solve those problems. 

Overall this was a super fun project, and I'm looking forward to building a new portfolio!
